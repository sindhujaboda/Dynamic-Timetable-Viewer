                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The College Class Schedule Management System is a web-based platform designed to help students, faculty, and staff view and manage class schedules at the college. 
                    The system allows users to filter class schedules by parameters such as year, department, section, and day, offering a personalized view of the academic schedule.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Calendar:</strong> Easily navigate through months to find class schedules for specific days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Class Schedule Filters:</strong> Filter schedules by year, department, section, and day for a customized view.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Schedule Table:</strong> View detailed class schedules including timing, subject, faculty, room number, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resizable and Sliding Table:</strong> Resize the schedule table to fit your screen and preferences.</li>

                    Once logged into the system, users can select their preferred parameters such as year, department, section, and day using a form. The system then displays a table with the relevant schedule information.
                    Users can also view the class schedule on a month-by-month basis using the interactive calendar feature.
                </p>
